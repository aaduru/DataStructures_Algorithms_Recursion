Stacks and queues are two simple linear data structures. Elements are stored in order and can be added or removed one at a time. The difference between a stack and a queue is that a stack is first in, last out (FILO) while a queue is first in, first out (FIFO). Unlike Ruby's Array data structure, most Stack and Queue implementations do not expose methods to slice or sort the data, or to find a specific element. The basic operations are:

#Stack
#push:
adds an element to the top of the stack
#pop:
removes an element from the top of the stack and returns it
#Queue
#enqueue:
adds an element to the back of the queue
#dequeue:
removes an element from the front of the queue and returns it
